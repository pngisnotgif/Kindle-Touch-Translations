Kindle-Touch-Translations
=========================

Chinese Translation(zh_CN &amp; zh_TW)

These translations are based on Transifex(https://www.transifex.net/projects/p/kindle-touch-framework/).


What are these files
====================

.tx		- transfex configuration files.

translations	- the translations.

scripts		- all the scripts files.

	RUN.sh	- my shell script, and needs modifying for everyone's use.
	
	CN2TW.txt   - the VBA script that I use in Word to auto-tranlaste zh_CN to zh_TW., which you can change extname to vbs(? i'm not so sure :-( ).
    
	dir_name.txt	- the files name that I use in VBA script.
	
	����ת��.csv		- the translation table for zh_CN to zh_TW.
    
tx.exe		- the git-like executive program of transfex, but not as functional as git.
